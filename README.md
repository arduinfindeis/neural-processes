# Neural Processes
by [@ciupakabra](https://github.com/ciupakabra), [@florianlanger](https://github.com/florianlanger) and [@arduinfindeis](https://github.com/arduinfindeis).

This repository contains a TensorFlow 2 implementation of neural processes. The neural process model was introduced in this [paper by Garnelo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622). Their [TensorFlow 1 implementation](https://github.com/deepmind/neural-processes) has been a useful reference for this implementation. Many of the experiments in the original paper are reproduced here, including 1-D regression and image completion tasks (for MNIST and CelebA).

- **Model training:** see `*.py` for model setup and training scripts for the different tasks.
- **Paper figures:** see `*.ipynb` notebook files for the code to reproduce similar figures to the paper.
- **Model weights:** for weights of trained model see `weights` folder.
